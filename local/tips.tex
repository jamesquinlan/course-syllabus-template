	\1  Pre-read the material prior to coming to class.

	\1 Stay on track and don't wait until the due date to do all of your homework.

	\1  Ask questions when you don't understand something. Ask in class, via email, or during office hours.

	\1 Form study groups with your fellow classmates.

	\1  Attend every class. Be on time for every class. Participate in the lecture by asking questions, answering questions, and practicing problems.

	\1 Stay organized. Your notebook should be organized so that you can find class handouts and lecture notes.

	\1  Although some of your homework will not be turned in to your instructor, keep your work neat and organized. All homework should be used as a study guide for quizzes and exams. You should be doing most of your homework by hand, on paper, as you would during a test. Keeping this work will allow you to see what you did and enable you to study more effective
