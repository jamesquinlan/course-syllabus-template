\begin{itemize}

\item  Pre-read the material prior to coming to class.

\item Stay on track and don't wait until the due date to do all of your homework.
\item  Ask questions when you don't understand something. Ask in class, via email, or during
office hours.

\item Form study groups with your fellow classmates.
\item  Attend every class. Be on time for every class. Participate in the lecture by asking
questions, answering questions, and practicing problems.

\item Stay organized. Your notebook should be organized so that you can find class handouts
and lecture notes.

\item Although some of your homework will not be turned in to your instructor, keep your work
neat and organized. All homework should be used as a study guide for quizzes and
exams. You should be doing most of your homework by hand, on paper, as you would
during a test. Keeping this work will allow you to see what you did and enable you to
study more effective
