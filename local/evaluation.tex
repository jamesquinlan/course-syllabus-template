Grades are based on:
    Attendance/Participation (10\%), 
    exams (2 @ 10\%), 
    homework (20\%), 
    projects (40\%), and 
    final exam (10\%).   

The grade of ``I" (incomplete) can be given ONLY when a student, 
who is doing otherwise acceptable work (passing grade) and cannot 
complete a part of work (e.g., the final exam) because of documented 
illness or other conditions beyond the studentâ€™s control. 
In the latter case, the student must discuss the situation with the 
instructor and complete an application form from the department before 
the part of the work is due or as soon as the circumstances are known.
